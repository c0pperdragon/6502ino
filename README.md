# 6502ino

An Arduino shield with a 65c02 processor that can be used as a co-processor to
the atmega or the atmega can be used as an io-controller for the main
program running on the 65c02, or any other configuration.

The main objective of this design was to use as few components as possible to
make a 6502 work and communicate with the outside world. I was able to shrink
the circuitry down to a size that it can now be done with through-hole
components and still fit the form factor.
